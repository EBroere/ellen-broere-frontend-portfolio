              <p class="card-text bg-light">
                During the SheCodes React course, I built a highly interactive
                dictionary app using the React.js framework.
                <br />
                <br />
                This project helped me master React's key concepts, like state
                management and reusable components. I integrated multiple APIs
                to enhance the app, including features like word definitions,
                phonetics, related images, and even the current weather tied to
                the word search. This made the app both informative and
                engaging.
                <br />
                <br />
                In the future, I plan to add a "Listen" feature using another
                API, allowing users to hear the pronunciation of words.
                <br />
                <br />
                This project showcases my growing skills in React and my ability
                to create dynamic, user-friendly applications.

              <p class="card-text bg-light">
                In the SheCodes React Add-On course, I developed a dynamic
                weather app using the React.js framework. This project allowed
                me to deepen my understanding of React's capabilities while
                integrating real-time data from a weather API.
                <br />
                <br />
                The app features a user-friendly interface where users can
                easily search for weather conditions in any city. It provides
                detailed weather information, including temperature, humidity,
                and weather conditions, all updated in real-time.
                <br />
                <br />
                I also added a toggle button that allows users to switch between
                Celsius and Fahrenheit, offering flexibility in how the
                temperature is displayed.
                <br />
                <br />
                This project highlights my ability to build interactive
                applications with React and effectively use APIs to deliver
                real-time data. It's a reflection of my growing expertise in web
                development and my commitment to creating practical,
                user-centered solutions.

              <p class="card-text bg-light">
                In the SheCodes Responsive Add-On course, I created a website
                dedicated to one of my favorite travel spots, Koh Samet.
                <br />
                <br />
                Learning how to translate a design from Figma into a fully
                responsive website was a rewarding experience. The project
                allowed me to put design concepts into action, ensuring the site
                looks great and functions smoothly across all devices.
                <br />
                <br />
                Building this site was a joy, as it combined my passion for web
                development with my love for travel. I paid close attention to
                detail to showcase the beauty of Koh Samet, hoping to inspire
                others to visit this stunning destination.
                <br />
                <br />
                This project reflects my ability to turn design ideas into
                reality and my dedication to creating visually appealing and
                user-friendly websites. I highly recommend the course to anyone
                interested in learning how to make responsive websites that
                adapt seamlessly to any device.

              <h5 class="card-title">Over Skincare Enzo</h5>
              <p class="card-text bg-light">
                My interest in skincare grew significantly over time, leading me
                to become a go-to resource for tips and tricks among friends and
                family. Encouraged by their suggestions, I started an Instagram
                page to share my skincare knowledge. Although I made an initial
                effort, I struggled to find time to fully develop the page.
                <br />
                <br />
                During the SheCodes courses, I realized that a dedicated website
                would enhance my skincare project. This led to the creation of
                "Over Skincare Enzo," a site where I can offer detailed skincare
                advice and tips. While the website is still a work in progress,
                it marks a significant step forward from the Instagram page and
                represents my commitment to sharing valuable skincare insights.
                <br />
                <br />
                This project highlights my dedication to combining personal
                interests with technical skills, even as I continue to develop
                and expand the site.

              <p class="card-text bg-light">
                During the SheCodes Responsive course, I focused on creating a
                website dedicated to the Pilea peperomioides plant.
                <br />
                <br />
                Throughout the course, I got better at using CSS Media Queries
                to make sure the website looked good and responsive on different
                devices. I used Live Server in VSCode to keep testing and
                improving the site. I also learned about the differences between
                static and dynamic websites, which helped me decide how to host
                my site.
                <br />
                <br />
                One big part of the project was making sure the site showed up
                well on search engines, so I spent time tweaking things for SEO
                (Search Engine Optimization). I used tools like an SEO page
                checker to make sure the content and structure of the site were
                good for search engines, helping it rank better.
                <br />
                <br />
                I paid a lot of attention to detail to make the website look
                nice, showing off the beauty of the Pilea peperomioides plant
                while also showing off what I learned about web development.
                <br />
                <br />
                From making it work on different screens to getting it noticed
                online, this project really shows off what I learned in the
                SheCodes Responsive course. It's a sign of how much I care about
                getting good at web development and creating cool stuff online.

                Welcome to the World Clock, a project I developed to explore
                time zones and challenge myself with both digital and analog
                clock displays. <br />
                <br />
                Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I've created a user-friendly
                interface where you can select different locations to view their
                current time. Not only does it feature digital clocks for
                accuracy, but also analog clocks for a classic touch.
                <br />
                <br />

                <br /><br />
                To use the generator, simply type in your desired word or topic,

                wisdom, or inspiration, this tool has you covered.

                Welcome to Dino's Doggy Domain, a webpage all about my adorable
                dog, Dino! I've built this page from scratch using HTML, CSS,
                and JavaScript. It's my way of showcasing my web development
                skills.
                <br /><br />
                On this page, you'll find all the basics like headings,
                paragraphs, images, and buttons. With CSS, I've added some cool
                stuff like backgrounds that change, making the page more
                interesting. Plus, I've used CSS to make sure everything looks
                good on different screens with grids.
                <br /><br />
                You can even switch between a Dark or Light theme for a
                different look. And at the bottom, you'll see my name, just to
                let you know who made this page.
                <br /><br />
                Feel free to explore Dino's Doggy Domain to see how I've put
                everything together to celebrate my wonderful dog, Dino!

                Welcome to my Sweet Potato Fries landing page, where I've put my
                skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to work. I've built this
                page from scratch, incorporating essential HTML elements such as
                headings (h1, h2), paragraphs, divs, spans, strong, emphasis,
                line breaks, horizontal rules, links, images, and buttons.
                <br /><br />
                With CSS, I've added style to the page, adjusting things like
                spacing (margin, padding), text size (font size), font weight,
                colors, background (including linear gradient), line height, box
                shadow, borders, and transitions.
                <br /><br />
                In JavaScript, I've made the page interactive, with features
                like variables (let), conditional statements (if, else), user
                prompts (alert, prompt), and event handling.
                <br /><br />
                Take a look around to see how I've combined these skills to
                create a user-friendly and engaging experience!
